## 🔄 How to Use These Plans

1. **Before Starting Work**: Read the relevant version plan completely

3. **After Milestones**: Playtest against acceptance criteria, gather feedback
4. **Planning Next Version**: Reference overall.md for long-term direction

## 🎮 Client vs Server

**Important**: MineWorld produces **both** client and server from the same codebase:

- **Client Build**: Full game with rendering, UI, audio
- **Server Build**: Headless dedicated server (no rendering)

Both are built from this repository and share:
- Game logic (blocks, items, worldgen, rules)
- Commands implementation
- Plugin loading
- Save format
