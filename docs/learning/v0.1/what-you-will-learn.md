### 5. User Interface
**Enterprise Analogy**: Like web forms, but immersive and game-like

**Concepts**:
- **HUD Elements**: Always-visible information
- **Menu Systems**: Organized access to functions
- **Dialog Boxes**: Specific interactions
- **Tooltips**: Contextual help and information

**UI Components**:
- **Health Bar**: Player's current health
- **Hunger Bar**: Player's hunger level
- **Hotbar**: Selected items
- **Crosshair**: Aiming indicator
